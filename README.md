# Game Overview
Connect 4 is a two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping their colored chips from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own chips.
